# From the silvermantest package cited in the paper, we extracted the three main functions necessary to perform
# the test. We also modified so that k = 1 is the default, and the returned
# value of the silverman.test is a list containing the p-value and saved seed.
# The method used in the bootstrap is the one described in Silverman 1981, which is slightly different
# from the method used in the original silvermantest package
# The original behavior of rounding p-values to 0 if they are below 0.005 was also removed.
